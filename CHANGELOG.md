# Changelog

## 0.10.0

Breaking changes

* @iov/crpto: the new types `Secp256k1Signature` and `ExtendedSecp256k1Signature` replace DER encoded signatures in `Secp256k1`.
* @iov/keycontrol: `Secp256k1HdWallet.createTransactionSignature` now uses the custom fixed length encoding instead of DER to allow blockchains utilizing the recovery parameter.

## 0.9.1

* @iov/stream: Generalize `streamPromise` to take a promise of an iterable
* @iov/bns: Fix order of events in `listenTx`. All history tx events are now emitted before updates.

## 0.9.0

* @iov/core: Export `Secp256k1HdWallet` and import by default in @iov/cli.
* @iov/faucets: Postpone removal of `BovFaucet` to 0.10.x

Breaking changes

* @iov/bcp-types: Rename `FungibleToken` to `Amount`
* @iov/bns: Re-generate BNS codec from weave v0.9.0 and adapt wrapper types.
* @iov/bns: Add support for blockchain and username NFTs
* @iov/crypto: Convert pubkey of Secp256k1Keypair into uncompressed format with prefix `04`.
* @iov/crypto: Secp256k1.createSignature/.verifySignature now comsume a message hash and do no hashing internally.
* @iov/dpos: Rename `Amount`/`parseAmount` to `Quantity`/`parseQuantity`
* @iov/keycontrol: Let `Secp256k1HdWallet` work on uncompressed pubkeys. Since `Secp256k1HdWallet`
  was not used yet, there is no migration for existing `Secp256k1HdWallet`.
* @iov/tendermint-types: Move types `PrivateKeyBundle`, `PrivateKeyBytes` into @iov/bns;
  split `Tag` into `BcpQueryTag` in @iov/bcp-types and `QueryTag` in @iov/tendermint-rpc;
  rename `TxQuery` into `BcpTxQuery` in @iov/bcp-types; make `SignatureBundle` available
  in @iov/tendermint-rcp only and rename to `VoteSignatureBundle`; move `buildTxQuery` into @iov/bns.
* @iov/tendermint-types: renamed to @iov/base-types

## 0.8.1

* @iov/dpos: Deduplicate `Serialization` from Lisk and RISE
* @iov/keycontrol: Add `Wallet.printableSecret` and `UserProfile.printableSecret`
* @iov/keycontrol: Add `HdPaths.bip44` and `HdPaths.metamaskHdKeyTree` HD path builders
* @iov/tendermint-rpc: Ensure transaction search results are sorted by height

## 0.8.0

* @iov/dpos: Add new package with shared code for Lisk and RISE. Don't use this directly. No code change necessary for users of @iov/lisk and @iov/rise.
* @iov/faucets: add `IovFaucet` to connect to the new faucet application
* @iov/keycontrol: add format versioning to `Wallet`, `Keyring`, keyring encryption and `UserProfile`

Deprecations

* @iov/faucets: `BovFaucet` is deprecated and will be removed in 0.9. Migrate to the `IovFaucet`.

Breaking changes

* @iov/lisk: LiskConnection.postTx does not wait for block anymore (analogue to RiseConnection.postTx),
  making it faster and more reliable. Transaction state tracking will improve in the future.
* Due to updates in all serialization formats, UserProfiles stored with
  earlier versions of IOV-Core cannot be opened with 0.8.0. To migrate to
  the new version, extract the secret data using an older version and
  create a new UserProfile in 0.8.0.

## 0.7.1

* @iov/bcp-types: `Nonce` is now implemented by `Int53` from @iov/encoding instead of `Long`

* @iov/keycontrol: `Ed25519KeyringEntry` now takes a keypair as an argument in `createIdentity()`
* @iov/keycontrol: `Ed25519SimpleAddressKeyringEntry` was removed in favour of `Ed25519HdWallet` together with `HdPaths.simpleAddress`
* @iov/keycontrol: in `UserProfile`, `.entriesCount`, `.entryLabels` and `.entryIds` have been merged into `.wallets`
* @iov/keycontrol: in `UserProfile`, `.setEntryLabel`, `.createIdentity`, `.setIdentityLabel`, `.getIdentities`, `.signTransaction`, `.appendSignature` now only accept string IDs for the entry/wallet argument

* @iov/keycontrol: in `UserProfile`, rename `.addEntry/.setEntryLabel` to `.addWallet/.setWalletLabel`
* @iov/ledger-bns: in `LedgerSimpleAddressKeyringEntry`, `.createIdentity` takes an index argument
* @iov/ledger-bns: rename `LedgerSimpleAddressKeyringEntry` to `LedgerSimpleAddressWallet`
* Due to updates in the Keyring serialization, UserProfiles stored with
  earlier versions of IOV-Core cannot be opened with 0.7.0. To migrate to
  the new version, extract the secret data using an older version and
  create a new UserProfile in 0.7.0.

## 0.6.1

* @iov/bcp-types: various refactorings to improve multi chain support

Other notes

* The new name for keyring entries is "wallet". A keyring contains multiple wallets. This transition was started
  with the intoduction of Ed25519HdWallet and Secp256k1HdWallet and other incompatible API changes will follow in 0.7.
* We welcome our first external code contributor @SpasZahariev! If you want to get familiar woth the codebase,
  check the issues labeled with "good first issue".

## 0.6.0

* @iov/bns: transaction search can handle unlimited number of results

Breaking changes

* Due to updates in the Keyring serialization, UserProfiles stored with
  earlier versions of IOV-Core cannot be opened with 0.6.0. To migrate to
  the new version, extract the secret data using an older version and
  create a new UserProfile in 0.6.0.

* @iov/core and @iov/keycontrol: add keyring entry IDs
* @iov/keycontrol: ensure Ed25519SimpleAddressKeyringEntry.fromEntropyWithCurve/ and .fromMnemonicWithCurve return the correct type

**Note: this version was published with an outdated build
and should not be used**

## 0.5.1

  the new version, extract the secret data using 0.4.1 and create a new
  UserProfile in 0.5.0.
* The IovWriter construction is changed. You can probably save a line there.
  Please look at @iov/core README to see how to build it.

* @iov/ledger-bns: LedgerSimpleAddressKeyringEntry.startDeviceTracking() must be called
  before getting device state or calling createIdentity()/createTransactionSignature()
* The name field from the `getAccount` result data does not contain
  the chain ID anymore. Before

      [ { name: 'admin*test-chain-HexTMJ',
      address:
       Uint8Array [
         177,
         202, ...

  Now:

      [ { name: 'admin',
