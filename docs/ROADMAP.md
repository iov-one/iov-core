# Technical Roadmap (Rough)

This is a rough map of major points that need to be done to reach
some milestones

The Roadmap is a work-in-progress, so please add comments to help clarify and point out missing items

## Web4-read/write MVP

MVP just shows we can generate HD keys, save/load them, and use them to sign transactions and send tokens on the network.

- [x] HD Keyring works (with fixed path)
- [x] KeyringController handles persistence
- [x] We can encode the sendtx transaction for bcp-demo (`bns-codec`)
- [x] Tendermint RPC client
- [x] Client wrapper to parse data as defined in [bcp-minimal](https://github.com/iov-one/bcp-spec/blob/master/library/web4/rpc/README.md#bcp-minimal)
- [x] Simple cli (using repl) tool that will use `web4` codebase to sign and send transactions. Queries proper nonce from the chain

## Wallet integration

- [ ] Cleanup, open source, and publish web4 to npm
- [ ] Produce a webapp that can show account balances using above interface
- [ ] Enhance webapp to show tx history

## Ledger integration

- [x] Implement ledger app that can sign BNS transactions with ed25519
- [x] Call into ledger app from Typescript repo (iov-ledger-bns)
- [ ] Wrap ledger into KeyringEntry interface (like Ed25519SimpleAddress)
- [ ] Update all bcp-demo code and client code to always prehash sha512
- [ ] Demo usage in CLI
- [ ] Investigate possibilities and integrate into web wallet (if possible???) 

## BCP-Proxy MVP for one chain

- [ ] Add `bcp-client` that talks to `bcp-proxy` and fulfills bcp-basic blockchain interface (as above)
- [ ] Add `bcp-proxy` implementation that communicates with a tendermint chain (demo: combing client and server)
- [ ] Add `bcp-proxy` implementation that communicates with Lisk 1.0.0 chains
- [ ] Update above webapp to query over both Lisk and Tendermint chains with a chain selector

## Streaming interface

- [ ] Clarify interface for blockchain client, including subscriptions (observable)
- [ ] Enhance Tendermint RPC wrapper to fulfill interface
- [ ] Enhance BCP Proxy client and server to fulfil interface
- [ ] Update wallet to use new realtime/reactive interface

## Add support for NFTs (bns only)

- [ ] DEPENDENCY: implement NFTs in bcp-demo
- [ ] Update bns protobuf definitions from new bcp protobuf files 
- [ ] Add more transaction types and codec support
- [ ] Define interfaces (BcpMinimal, BcpNFTs, BcpSwap, etc....)
- [ ] Write integration tests of NFT transfer with bcp-demo

## Ethereum Proxy

- [ ] Add secp256k1 HD support to `keybase` (same hd path as ed25519simpleaddress for now)
- [ ] Add `bcp-proxy` support to provide `bcp-basic` queries for account balance
- [ ] Add support for sendtx with ETH (encode simple transaction and submit to blockchain)
- [ ] Enable querying all transactions per account
- [ ] Add support for 1 testnet, mainnet, and poanetwork
- [ ] Extend sendtx and queries to handle erc20 tokens, by hardcoding a lookup of token name to contract address and sigfigs
- [ ] Transaction history shows ERC20 amounts as well as ETH amounts
- [ ] Implement atomic swap contract in solidity
- [ ] Add swap transactions and queries that interact with our uploaded swap contract (using hardcoded contract address)
- [ ] Sign Ethereum tx with same HD path as metamask. Importing mnemonic enables use in web4 and metamask
- [ ] Verify we can use Ethereum chains just like Lisk or `bcp-demo` chain with same webapp, and switch between chains

## Value name support

- [ ] Add transactions to buy, transfer, swap values names (building on NFTs)
- [ ] Improve queries to show proper names for account lookups (bns surely and bcp-proxy maybe?)
- [ ] Expose API for integration in web wallet (using observables as above)

------------------- Goal for sometime in October ----------------------

Questions:
 * Is above goal reasonable at all?
 * What positions do we need to hire to fulfil this goal?
  * Current plan is solidity/web4 dev and backend js/typescript dev (one each)

------------------ Rough ideas for Q4 and beyond ------------------------

## Web4-write Extension MVP (chrome and firefox?)

- This is to create the equivalent of the metamask plugin using web4 library under the hood... one approach to securely handle keys in Blockchain UIs, but not the only
- [ ] Define public API to call `web4-write` from webapp
- [ ] Design simple chrome extension that displays data from `web4-write`, creates accounts, requests confirmations on signing transactions
- [ ] Update webapp to talk to web4-write to query current account and show that balance
- [ ] Update webapp to send "sendtx" requests to web4-write based on user input in webapp
- [ ] MVP should show balances and allow sending in normal webapp, all keys and transactions confirmation in chrome extension
- [ ] Support both `bcp-demo` and Lisk (and Ethereum, if implemented already) chains (via `bcp-proxy`)

## Enhancement: Flexible Web4-Read
Depends on: Backend implementation and deployment of "bcp-plus" chain as `bcp-demo` extended

- [ ] Design extensible query endpoints from `web4-read` -> `bcp-proxy` -> `blockchain`
- [ ] Define some `query templates` to explain possible queries
- [ ] Add `codec definition format` for protobuf parsing and transformation, use this with `tendermint-rpc` to talk to a `bcp-plus` chain
- [ ] Provide documentation for adding a query over `bcp-proxy` (using in turn the expanded tendermint-rpc client to talk to the blockchain).

## Enhancement: Flexible Web4-Write

- [ ] Design `meta-codec` format that can generate chain-specific tx-codec for a "blockchain family" given a definition file...
  - all weave-based systems could share a meta-codec that allows adding individual tx,
  - all Ethereum chains could customize the swap contract in their definition, etc.
- [ ] Add definitions for `bcp-demo` and `bcp-plus` example to the package
- [ ] Auto-generate chain codecs from `meta-codec` + definition in "txBuilder" lookup
- [ ] Sign `bcp-plus` transactions using only definitions
- TODO....

## Enhancement: BNS Integration
Depends on: BNS implementation on backend completed and deployed

- [ ] Add `BCP-Plus` query integration for full BNS feature set
- [ ] Complete full `tx-codec` support for all BNS transactions
- [ ] Add support for name lookup via chrome extension
- [ ] Add management of value name (registration/transfer) to Chrome extension
- [ ] Add lookup of chains via chrome extension and webapp (extend "chain selector")
- [ ] Add queries and browsing of names/chains via webapp (not extension)

## Enhancement: Other chains

- [ ] Stellar
- [ ] Ripple?
- [ ] Cosmos Hub
- [ ] NEO
- [ ] Tezos
- [ ] Various Lisk/Ethereum compatible forks (since we have the code already)

## Enhancement Dynamic Codecs

- [ ] Support downloading codec definitions from BNS
- TODO: Add more detail

## Enhancement: Secure Queries

- [ ] Add merkle proofs to all weave/bcp-demo/bns query responses
- [ ] Write typescript light-client implementation to verify headers and proofs
- [ ] Integrate this with tendermint rpc to produce secure query
- [ ] Use Secure Queries to query BNS chain, provide a "root of trust" header in the app
- TODO....

## Enhancement: Electron App

- [ ] Package webapp containing `web4-read` and `web4-write` into an  electron binary
- [ ] Provide streamlined integration of confirmation steps, as the binary should trust itself
- [ ] Provide packaged version of electron app for download
- [ ] Experiment with deterministic builds, allowing multiple people to compile and sign the same binary
- TODO....

## Enhancement: React-Native App

- [ ] Package webapp containing `web4-read` and `web4-write` into a react-native binary
- [ ] Provide simple tx sending workflow (as per electron app)
- [ ] Provide downloadable version of Android (and iOS?) app for download
- [ ] Experiment with deterministic builds, allowing multiple people to compile and sign the same binary
- TODO....

## Earlier work

* `iov-keybase` was a start to sketch out a public api that could be used when used out of process
  as a browser extension.
  It's available on the git tag `iov-keybase`: https://github.com/iov-one/web4/tree/iov-keybase/packages/iov-keybase
* The `KeyController` interface was an approach to design the key controller from top to bottom,
  which has been superceeded by a bottom-to-top approach that resulted in the now active UserProfile.
  It's available on the git tag `keycontroller-interface`: https://github.com/iov-one/web4/blob/keycontroller-interface/packages/iov-keycontrol/src/keycontroller.d.ts
