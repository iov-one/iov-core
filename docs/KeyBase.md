# Keybase Architecture

This document details the construction of an BCP compatible keybase system. It
describes the core concepts of UserProfiles, Keyrings, and the identity types
they contain.

## Key Terms:

- `UserProfile`: A collection of User materials. Includes multiple
  `keyringEntries` associated with a `UserProfile`.
- `Keyring`: An object containing `keyringEntry`'s.
- `KeyringEntry`: An object which houses ONE `SeedIdentity` and N
  `PublicIdentities`.
- `SeedIdentity`: Single Private material entry in a `KeyringEntry`, used for
  deriving a `secret` to sign transactions and generate `PublicIdentities`.
- `PublicIdentities`: Public materials collection. Contains the an array of
  objects related to a `SeedIdentity`.
- `PublicIdentity`: A collection of information derived from a `secret`. It
  includes an address, publicKey, and HD path data which is always defined via
  the HD specifications. Used for end user queries for balances and transaction
  histories.

## Feature Set:

The Keybase includes a fully featured suite of key management. This includes the
creation of new seeds, publickeys, and addresses. It also includes the usage of
a Hardware Wallet, and various cryptographic algorithms.

### Generation of HD Seeds

The iov-core Keybase will require the ability to generate new seeds from entropy
for a user, when needed. This can occur when a UserProfile is made, or later on
demand by the User.

### Import/Export of HD Seeds

Users will also need the ability to Import seeds from other software, and Export
Seeds from iov-core for reuse in other software.

### Creation of Public Keys, and Addresses

The Seeds generated by the Keybase will be used to create new public keys, and
addresses for use with blockchain technology. This will be done using standard
HD derivation techniques.

### Support for secp256k1 and ed25519

These are the two "industry standard" cryptographic algorithms. Both need to be
supported to enable the greatest compatibility. Others can be supported later,
such as `bls signatures` or `zk-snarks`.

### Hardware wallets, Ledger (Others TBA)

Hardware wallet support is necessary as more users are using these devices and
they provide extremely high security for the key material while remaining
practical to use. Ledger will be the first device type supported by the Keybase.

### Transaction/Message operations

The Keybase will have the following features:

- Sign and Verify Transactions
- Sign and Verify Messages

### Profile and HD Seed encryption

All data entered into a profile is encrypted before it is stored on disk.
Additionally, individual KeyringEntries can be encrypted by a separate
passphrase.

## Standards Used:

The Keybase will implement a variety of standards regarding address derivation
and timestamp generation. These have been listed here for review.

### Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets

HD wallets will be created through this standard to yield a master
publickey:privatekey pair.

- BIP32: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki

### Multi-Account Hierarchy for Deterministic Wallets

HD Wallets for chain specific support will be created through the following
standards for each algorithm.

#### secp256k1

- BIP43: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0043.mediawiki
- BIP44: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki

#### ed25519

- SLIP-0010: https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0010.md

#### Both

- SLIP-0044: https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md

### HD Seed Generation:

Seed generation will be performed through the BIP39 specification for HD seeds

- BIP39: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki

### Timestamp Generation

Timestamps are generated using a widely known standard to enable deterministic
parsing.

- RFC 3339: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339

# Code Architecture

The code for keyring management is broken down into logical units, each
performing a specific task. The design can be visualized as follows:

```
UserProfileController (1 UserProfileController)
  |
  | > UserProfile (1 UserProfile : N Users)
      |
      | > AddressBook (1 AddressBook : 1 UserProfile)
      |   | > AddressBookEntries (1 AddressBook : N AddressBookEntries)
      |
      | > SecurityModel (1 SecurityModel : 1 UserProfile)
      |
      | > Keyring (1 Keyring : 1 UserProfile)
          |
          | > keyringEntries (1 Keyring : N KeyringEntries)
              |
              | > SeedIdentity (1 KeyringEntry : 1 SeedIdentity)
                  |
                  | > PublicIdentities (1 SecretIdentity : N PublicIdentities)
```

## UserProfileController

The primary purpose of the `UserProfileController` is to manage multiple
`UserProfile`s. It provides the logic to manipulate `UserProfile`s.

The following functions are called by the `User`, through the
`UserProfileController`

### Functions:

- CreateUserProfile: Creates a new user in the `UserProfileController`
- LoginUserProfile: Passes `username:password` pair to the
  `UserProfileController`
- DeleteUserProfile: Requests deletion of a `UserProfile` to the
  `UserProfileController`
- ExportUserProfile: Requests the plaintext export of `UserProfile` details,
  requires a correct `login`

### Object Definition:

```
{
  "UserProfiles": []
}
```

## UserProfile

A `UserProfile` contains an object called `keyring`, an object called
`addressBook`, and an object called `securityModel`. This is a `1:N` relation,
where `N` is each `UserProfile` created by the `UserProfileController`.

### Object Definition:

```
"UserProfile": {
  "username": "isabella",
  "label": "My Profile",
  "created": "1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z", # RFC 3339
  "securityModel": {
    "timeout": 3600
  },
  "keyring": {
    "keyringEntries": [],
  },
  "addressBook": {
    "addressBookEntries": []
  }
}
```

## AddressBook

Contains a list of addresses a user has interacted with, or added for frequent
use.

### Functions:

- AddContact: Adds a contact to a `AddressBook` with the specified information.
- DeleteContact: Deletes a contact from a `AddressBook`
- GetContact: Returns the `chain:address:humanName` for use in the application.
- ExportContact: Returns a `contact` in plain text for import in another
  iov-core system.
- ImportContact: Adds a `contact` from a predefined plain text entry.

### Object Definition:

```
"addressBook": {
  "addressBookEntries": [
    {
      "address": "0x52b96095d265a93308fcf5cb9627085f029546be8b3",
      "chain": {
        "chain": "ETH",
        "tickers": ["ETH","ANT"]
      },
      "created": "1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z", # RFC 3339
      "label": "Friend's Account"
    }
  ]
}
```

## SecurityModel

The `UserProfile` contains an object called `securityModel`. This object defines
the security parameters of the profile. The entries in this object establish
when a profile will lock down through inactivity. This is a `1:1` relation
inside of a `UserProfile`.

### Functions:

- GetSecurityDetails: Returns a security information for the `UserProfile`.
- ModifySecurityDetails: Changes security information for the `UserProfile`.

### Object Definition:

```
"securityModel": {
  "timeout": 3600
},
```

## Keyring

The `Keyring` is an object that houses `keyringEntries`. This object holds all
of the `UserProfile`'s `KeyringEntry`s. This is a `1:1` relation inside of a
`UserProfile`.

### Functions:

- GetKeyringEntry: Returns a requested `KeyringEntry`'s details, such as
  `PublicIdentities`.
- AddKeyringEntry: Adds a new `KeyringEntry`, with an autogenerated or imported
  `SecretIdentity` to the `Keyring`.
- DeleteKeyringEntry: Removes an existing `KeyringEntry` from the `Keyring`.
- ExportKeyringEntry: Exports a `KeyringEntry` in plain text, for use in another
  `Keyring`.
- ImportKeyringEntry: Imports a whole `KeyringEntry`, complete with a
  `SecretIdentity` and the list `PublicIdentities`.

### Object Definition:

```
"keyring": {
  "keyringEntries": []
},
```

## KeyringEntry

A `KeyringEntry` contains all of the related `SeedIdentity`, `PublicIdentities`
and personality information for an associated `SeedIdentity`.

A `SeedIdentity` is only an HD Seed value (`Mnemonic Passphrase`) or a hardware
device identifier for a `Ledger`.

This is a `1:1` relation, where each `KeyringEntry` has one `SeedIdentity`.

### Functions:

- CreateSeedIdentity: Creates a `SeedIdentity`, if the `KeyRingEntry` has none.
- RenameSeedIdentity: Changes the label of the `keyringEntry`.
- DeleteSeedIdentity: Removes the `SeedIdentity` from the `keyringEntry`.
- ExportSeedIdentity: Exports the `SeedIdentity` in plain text. Only the type of
  `HD` can be exported.

### Object Definition:

```
"KeyringEntry": {
  "label": "My Account",
  "SeedIdentity": {
   "seed": "shift nature mean excess demise mule winter between swing success bitter patch",
   "type": "HD" || "hardware"
  },
  "PublicIdentities": [
    "PublicIdentity": {}
  ]
}
```

## PublicIdentities

A `PublicIdentities` are derived from `seed:curve` pairs, which are used to
create a `PublicIdentity`.

This is a `1:N` relation, where 1 is the `SeedIdentity` for which the
`PublicIdentity` is related and N are the generated `PublicIdentities`.

### Functions:

- GetPublicIdentity: Returns `PublicIdentity` details for a specific algorithm.
- CreatePublicIdentity: Creates a `PublicIdentity` from the `SeedIdentity`.
- DeletePublicIdentity: Removes a `PublicIdentity` from `PublicIdentities`.
- ExportPublicIdentity: Exports a `PublicIdentity` in plain text.

### Object Definition:

```
"PublicIdentities": [
  "PublicIdentity": {
    "address": "0x6806ea1d9b2eb59DAc7fdcdf28bf8d5a12AD84Bc",
    "label": "Wells Fargo",
    "publicKey": {
      "algo": ed25519,
      "data": "52b96095d265a93308fcf5cb9627085f029546be8b31eccb00bad386a92544d7"
    },
    "chain": {
      "chain": "ETH",
      "tickers": ["ETH","ANT"]
    },
    "path": {
      "root": "m",
      "purpose": "44'",
      "coinType": "60'", # Defined here: https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md
      "account": "0'",
      "change": "0'",
      "addressIndex": "0"
    },
  }
]
```

  }
}
```

# Security Concerns

There are a few minor security concerns around Seed management and private key
usage, these are addressed here.

## Persisting Seeds on Disk

Users will be forced to encrypt all HD Seeds kept on disk through their user
profile. Users will be given the option of a second layer of security by
encrypting each Seed separately.

## Private Keys Per Curve

We can reuse the same seed for each `Curve`, and derive different public/private
key pairs using the instructions found in SLIP-0010. Security concerns around
private key reuse are mitigated by using an HMAC-SHA512 pseudo random number
generator. This results in new private keys which are created for each curve.
This method is how Trezor and Ledger derive keys for different curves.
