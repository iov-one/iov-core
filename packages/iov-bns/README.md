# @iov/bns

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@iov/bns.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iov/bns)

This package is an implementation of the BlockchainConnection interface for the
BNS blockchain (currently just as
[bcp-demo](https://github.com/iov-one/bcp-demo) prototype). It should be able to
adapt this code fairly easily to support any other
[weave](https://github.com/iov-one/weave) based blockchain as well.

This provides a reference implementation of the full feature set of
`BlockchainConnection`, so it is also a good read when starting support of
another blockchain.

Simplest usage, to use auto-detecting tendermint client and standard bns
transaction parser:

```ts
const connection = await BnsConnection.establish(
  "ws://rpc-private-a-x-exchangenet.iov.one:16657",
);
```

## API Documentation

[https://iov-one.github.io/iov-core-docs/latest/iov-bns/](https://iov-one.github.io/iov-core-docs/latest/iov-bns/)

The main entry point is the
[BnsConnection](https://iov-one.github.io/iov-core-docs/latest/iov-bns/classes/bnsconnection.html),
which creates a Tendermint client (from `iov-tendermint-rpc`) and a codec to
parse transactions. The BNS codec for reading and writing transactions (also
useful for MultiChainSigner) is exported as top-level
[bnsCodec](https://iov-one.github.io/iov-core-docs/latest/iov-bns/globals.html#bnscodec).
